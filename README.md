# Android Studio (Play around the sensors)

The goal of this project is to pull together techniques shown in class to make a program which
responds graphically to accelerometer input. I am going to make a ball game!

## Approach:
*  Subclassing View
*  Using the Accelerometer
*  Adding constraints
*  Enabling Fullscreen mode
*  Drawing multiple balls
